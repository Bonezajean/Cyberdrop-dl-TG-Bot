## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Create `credentials.json`
In the root of the project, create a file called `credentials.json` with your botâ€™s credentials:

```
{
    "API_ID": "YOUR_API_ID",
    "API_HASH": "YOUR_API_HASH",
    "BOT_TOKEN": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
    "USER_ID": "YOUR_USER_ID",
    "DUMP_ID": "YOUR_DUMP_ID"
}
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
You can install the required dependencies with the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Permissions (if required)
If you're working in a restricted environment (such as a cloud server or Colab), you may need to adjust file permissions for certain directories. You can set permissions using:

```
sudo chmod 777 /teamspace/studios/
```

### 5. Run the Bot
To start the bot, run the main Python script:

```
python main.py
```

## Usage

### Telegram Commands
-`/start`: Start the bot and receive a welcome message.
- `/upload <URL>`: Provide one or more CyberDrop URLs (each on a new line). The bot will download, optionally rename, and upload the files to the specified chat.
- `/help`: Display help information and available commands.

### Example
```
/upload
https://cyberdrop.me/somefolder
https://cyberdrop.me/anotherfolder
```
The bot will download each folder and upload the files to the chat.

### Handling Renaming
After downloads are complete, the bot will ask if you want to rename the files. Respond with `yes` to provide a new base name for the files or `no` to keep the original names.
